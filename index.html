            <h3>A Modern Masterpiece</h3>
            <p>
              Squid Game is a South Korean survival drama television series
              created by Hwang Dong-hyuk for Netflix. The series revolves around
              a contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial
              hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's
              games for the chance to win a ₩45.6 billion prize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Released in 2021, the show quickly became Netflix's most-watched
              series, attracting more than 142 million member households during
              its first four weeks, surpassing Bridgerton as the network's
              most-watched show.
            </p>
            <p>
              The series has been praised for its originality, creativity,
              acting, visual style, musical score, and commentary on social
              inequality. It has attracted international attention and won
              numerous accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best
              Supporting Actor for O Yeong-su.

              <h3>Red Light, Green Light</h3>
              <p>
                The first game in the series, this traditional children's game
                takes a deadly turn. When the giant robot doll calls "Green
                Light," players can move toward the finish line. But when she
                calls "Red Light" and turns around, anyone still moving is
                immediately eliminated – not just from the game, but from life
                itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                The doll uses motion sensors to detect movement, and players
                have just five minutes to cross the finish line. The
                psychological horror of this game sets the tone for the entire
                series, as contestants realize the true stakes of the
                competition.

              <h3>Honeycomb / Dalgona Candy</h3>
              <p>
                In this game, players must cut out a shape from a fragile
                honeycomb candy using only a needle. The shapes vary in
                difficulty: umbrella, star, circle, and triangle. If the shape
                breaks during extraction, the player is eliminated.
              </p>
              <p>
                This game tests precision and patience under extreme pressure.
                Gi-hun discovers that licking the back of the candy helps melt
                it slightly, making the task easier – a clever strategy that
                saves his life.

              <h3>Tug of War</h3>
              <p>
                Teams of ten face off in a traditional tug-of-war match on
                elevated platforms. The losing team plummets to their death.
                This game highlights the importance of strategy over pure
                strength.
              </p>
              <p>
                Il-nam shares his knowledge: positioning team members
                alternating left and right for better grip, starting in a
                leaning position to hold ground, and waiting for the opponent to
                tire before pulling. Despite being physically weaker, Gi-hun's
                team overcomes their opponents using these tactics.
